Supernova
=========

Supernova consists of two main parts:

* `CLIPy <https://gitlab.com/claudiop/CLIPy>`_  (`CLIP-Crawler on PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/CLIP-Crawler/>`_) which
  is an HTTP crawler which sucks the life out of CLIP.
* The Supernova webservice, to which this documentation belongs. Just be aware that the Supernova webserver has no CLIP data
  without CLIPy and as such becomes sort of useless.

Since CLIPy is a standalone library and within this documentation I'll restrain myself to the Supernova webserver I'll
simply refer to it as Supernova, though they're bread and butter and in the future other "Supernova" derived works
(such as native apps) might surface.
