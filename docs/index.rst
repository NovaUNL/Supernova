Kleep
=====
| Kleep is an acronym for ... something! (yet totally forgot what it was)
| Of one thing I'm sure, it has nothing to do with that Campus Life Integration Platform thingy.

Kleep consists of two main parts:

* `CLIPy <https://gitlab.com/claudiop/CLIPy>`_  (`CLIP-Crawler on PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/CLIP-Crawler/>`_) which
  is an HTTP crawler which sucks the life out of CLIP.
* The Kleep webservice, to which this documentation belongs. Just be aware that the Kleep webserver has no CLIP data
  without CLIPy and as such becomes sort of useless.

Since CLIPy is a standalone library and within this documentation I'll restrain myself to the Kleep webserver I'll
simply refer to it as Kleep, though they're bread and butter and in the future other "Kleep" derived works
(such as native apps) might surface.
